*Getting started with AWS cloud servers (EC2) from the perspective of a web developer*

## **What's this all about?**

- I just want to deploy my site and focus on what's important
- I don't want to play around with platform configuration baggage right now
- I want to deploy in manner that's as close to "it works on my system" as possible
- I don't want to get "rabbit-holed" by documentation
